# In this example we fit spheres to a region of a surface defined by
# N points that are closest to a given point of the surface.
# For some of these point we show the fitting sphere.
# Red lines join the center of the sphere to the surface point.
# Blue points are the N points used for fitting.
# Green histogram is the distribution of residuals from the fitting.
# Red histogram is the distribution of the curvatures (1/r**2).
# Fitted radius can be accessed from attribute actor.radius
