# Example to show how to use recoSurface() to reconstruct a surface from points.
# 1. An object is loaded and noise is added to its vertices.
# 2. the point cloud is smoothened with MLS (see moving_least_squares.py)
# 3. cleanPolydata imposes a minimum distance among points where 
#    'tol' is the fraction of the actor size.
# 4. a triangular mesh is extracted from this set of sparse points
#    'bins' is the number of voxels of the subdivision
# NB: recoSurface only works with vtk version >7
#
