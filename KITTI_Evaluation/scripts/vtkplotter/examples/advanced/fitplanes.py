# In this example we fit a plane to regions of a surface defined by
# N points that are closest to a given point of the surface.
# For some of these point we show the fitting plane.
# Blue points are the N points used for fitting.
# Green histogram is the distribution of residuals from the fitting.
# Both plane center and normal can be accessed from the 
# attribute actor.center and actor.normal (direction is arbitrary).
